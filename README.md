> "Impossible, right? Compared to the enemy we're facing, you and I are the same, no more than dots! What's the point in comparing our heights? That is what makes this exciting! The smallest, the weakest - it doesn't matter! I should still wish to go and take over the world, with nothing more than my tiny dot of a body! Within my chest, beats the heart of the King of Conquerors!"
