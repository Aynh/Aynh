> "Whats the probability of drawing the ace of spades from a deck with no jokers? Normaly it would be 150. But what if its a brand new deck? The position of cards in a new deck are typically identical, so that means if you take out the jokers and draw the card at the very bottom, it's the ace of spades almost 100% of the time. Oh that's right! I didn't say a word about it being a new deck. Rather, you didn't ask. Being in the 'no' gives you the power to turn the probability of winning from 1.92% to 100%. The more knowledge of a party will be the inevitable victor."
