> "All humans are loved by another and build up emotions with them. That's nature's providence. There's no way around it. And it's pointless to question it. A bug with wings has no idea why, but it can't help but want to fly. When two people can't help but seek one another out, I think, in essence, it's exactly the same scenario."
