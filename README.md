> "It's just... a love that's continued for many years without straying is something that, to anyone who sees it, is beautiful and impossible to fault. But... Though it may be short, and it may be something that's become crooked and bent partway through, if they're serious about the way they feel... then I don't think that's something that isn't beautiful."
