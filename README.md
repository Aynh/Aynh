> "One day a man had a dream. He dreamed that he was a butterfly. He fluttered and fluttered, flew and flew. He so loved the feeling of freedom that he decided that he was a butterfly. But when he woke up, he wasn't a butterfly. He was a human after all. Then the man thought, 'I wonder if I, The Man, dreamed that I was a butterfly or if this moment is truly the dream. Maybe the man I am now is a dream that a butterfly is having."
