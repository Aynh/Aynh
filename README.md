> "You have already fulfilled my expectations. It appears that you’re still hiding a wealth of potential. I was watching you while your Guardians struggled to overcome their trials, and I could tell from your behavior and actions that you were always putting them first. And that didn’t change when Daemon set his trap. I witnessed your resolve to protect your Family, and I was impressed. Your Guardians also responded similarly. Sawada Tsunayoshi, I deem you worthy as boss of the tenth-generation Vongola Family"
