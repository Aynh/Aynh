> "To you, life was just something you acted out and ended, all according to someone else's script. That's why you were always quoting Shakespeare. However, Aika, I say that you were wrong! You did what you shouldn't have, and didn't do as you should have. Because you relied on someone else's script, you were wrong. I won't live my life by another person's script. Not by Hamlet or The Tempest. I don't know how many years in the future it will be... but I'll write and act my own ending."
