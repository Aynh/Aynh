> "'Believing in someone.' That's a weird phrase, isn't it? After all, if you truly believed in a person, you wouldn't need to say, 'I believe you.' It's like saying, 'I believe in air.' I don't mean to say that 'believing in something' is like a lie. 'Believing' is really a term of hope of wanting to believe."
