> "When you're in a town like this, all covered with smoke - you forget that there's a world outside. Nothing amazing happens here. And you get used to that. Used to a world where everything is ordinary. Every day we spend here is like a whole lifetime of dying slowly. But now Haruko is here. That's how I know there really is a world outside."
