> "Careful what you do, cuz 'God' is watching your every move. Hold my hand in the dark street, for if you do I know that I'll.. be safe. Even if I'm far away and alone, I can be sure that you'll find me there, this I know. You told me close for a while, so quite. You tell me everything. If I forget what to say then you'll come to me and tell me again, yes you'd tell me once again. But what happens when I know it all and what should I do, after that, what then?"
