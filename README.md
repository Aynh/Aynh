> "I don't like this, I don't like this, I don't like this. Sure, I know that I have no right to be feeling this way. But I still don't like it! I just don't like it. We were always together. I was always by his side. During time of joy, and grief as well. But...I realize he's far away from me now... I'm not by his side...there's somebody else there... I don't like this! Look at me! Look at me, will you? Not with those eyes... Don't look at someone else!"
