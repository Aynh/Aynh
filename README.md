> "You know, when I was in high school, I was a troublemaker. I hardly went to school. Before I knew it, I was expelled. When I couldn't go anymore, was when I first realized, that school was a great thing. There's a lot of friends and lots of fun things. When I got this old, I wanted even more to go to school. That's why I became a teacher. Because, if I become a teacher, I could stay in school until I die, right? That's why I'm really happy now. I want you to be like that too. I want you to like school. Once it's over, it's too late."
