> "No... this is wrong! Didn't I fall into hell? This can't be hell! Surrendering my body to the devil, I should have become a wrinkled hag! My hair should be full of hateful snakes, my skin should be the color of a vile frog's! And my blood should be burning with the jet black flames of my grudge..! A lie. This form, it's a lie! I've been tricked! I wanted to become a terrifying woman, one that just a look from, would send anyone running. I have to be such a woman! I don't want to forget my anger and hate!"
