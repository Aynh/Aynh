> "Listen. Right now, you're trying to shoulder someone else's life. That might be the right thing to do, but that act requires a lot of resolve. It'll become a thorn that can't be removed, and it'll continue to hurt you forever. The briar will continue to grow, but it'll never flower. It'll only hurt, it'll only cause you pain."
