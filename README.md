> "This strength doesn't make any sense. It's not fair. It's like he's made up of the world's unfairness. As if he is the personification of justice... of course. Didn't I already know? This world is unfair. Justice and evil are decided by others. That's how the world is. To oppose the unfair power known as justice, I have to obtain the unfair power known as evil. To defeat the unfair beings known as heroes I have to become an unfair being myself!"
