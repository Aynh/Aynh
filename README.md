> "I too used to believe that the world would be a better place if I hadn’t been born. I was hated merely for the fact that I existed, and I died for the happiness of many people. But there was one thing I wished for with all my heart... If I’m ever given a second chance in life, I want to live for only myself. That is my sincere wish."
