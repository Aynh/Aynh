> "To me, nothing is painful. There is no such thing as anguish. Even if some things seem like they hurt, deep down, everyone is a nice person. We can understand each other, or so I thought; or so I liked to think. I didn't want to wallow in misery. I didn't want to become spiteful. I just didn't want to be hurt. I didn't want to be hated."
