> "Why are people born? If people are born only to suffer the hard life, is it meant as some kind of punishment? Or a cynical joke? If that's the case, animals that adhere to the survival strategies programmed in their DNA are far more elegant and simple. If there really is an existence worthy of being called a God, I want to ask him just one thing: Is there really fate in the universe? If a man ignored fate, and ignored his instincts and DNA to love someone else... Dear God, is he really human? Just wondering. I hate the word 'fate'."
