> "All I ever gained from abandoning something and running away were regrets I couldn't do anything about, and a version of myself that could only resent others. If I come to hate myself, even living becomes a sin. Remorse alone will become my punishment. That's why I've decided to take action of my own free will, so I'll never have the same regrets again."
