> "If I hadn't met you, I never would have realized what kind of person I am. I would have grown into an apathetic, clueless, obedient adult. However, after spending time with you, in tears, laughter, and anger, I now know that I have all these emotions inside me, too. And that makes me proud. I'm glad to have known you."
