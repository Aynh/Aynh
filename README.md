> "I've done it! After years of climbing the ladder, I've finally made it! Now that I have control of all good, no one can stop me! I now rule the human race! First, I will restore all the long-abandoned customs! Control the people! Control the goods! Control the economy! Once that's done, I can easily take over the nation! I'm in position to wield all of the power! Time to implement a dictatorial democracy! I can be a tyrant!"
