> "Aki, you can't lie when you confess to someone. I'm trying to comfort you know, but if I just wanted to comfort you, I won't confess to you. I confessed to you like this because I really like you. But I do find it a little annoying how you fidget around like this, and I really hate you for blaming yourself and regretting your actions. -- and I really hate you when you said that a girl, who summoned all her courage to confess to you, is lying."
