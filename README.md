> "How did you learn of the reality that you speak of? The entire world is governed by the reasoning of dirty-minded adults. We're able to obscure reality according to our obsessions. We're never actually shown what reality is. In this case, the reality that you speak of is a half-baked nonsense that has been altered. Trying to conform this bullshit reality into the one you want is like trying to join two pieces of a puzzle that do not fit."
