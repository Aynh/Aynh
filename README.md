> "Girls who push their kindness onto others. I hate them to death. 'I have a really beautiful heart, so please fall in love with me!' I'm only surrounded by these types of girls and they piss me off. But it's not that simple. In the end, they are just making a fool of themselves. But you... You're different from the other girls. You don't have ulterior motives or anything to gain. You've always been easygoing. That's why to you, I thought It'd be okay to at least say thank you."
