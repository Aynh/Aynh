> "[thinking as Nel tells her to cheer for Ichigo] That's right. To begin with, I came here just thinking I wanted to protect everyone. But when I heard they had come to save me, I couldn't help but feel a little glad, just a bit in my heart. When I look at Kurosaki-kun in that mask, I think that he might not have come here to save me at all. Even though it's wrong, they shouldn't be going that far for me."
