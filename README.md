> "To ensure that all I've done won't end up a lie. I don't want to talk big game to people, then run away when it matters the most. This is a wall I must overcome on my own. If there's anything I want to change, I have to change myself. If I must become evil to defeat evil, I will become the devil himself. That's all to it."
