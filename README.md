> "If another me was born somewhere else, and had led a different life, how would he feel? If there was another version of myself somewhere on the other side of the ocean, what would happen if I were able to meet him? Would I be able to be his friend? Or would the differences in our upbringing be something that I couldn't overcome? Can I understand him because he is me? Or will he be impossible to understand because he's me?"
